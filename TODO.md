## TODO ##

* Implement multi-line comments
* If a label is duplicated, issue an error
* Write debug symbols to a file
* Write map (human readable assembled output) to a file
* Change Makefile to compile common .c files to .o files once rather than for each binary


## DONE ##

~~* If a label is undefined, issue an error~~
~~* Add line numbers to assembler errors~~
~~* Handle assembler lines with a label but no opcode~~
~~* Tweak assembler to take one file name; build other files (output, debug) based on that name~~
